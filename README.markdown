CodeIgniter Tutorial
==============================

This is adapted from the original [CodeIgniter video tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/tutorials) by Derek Jones. It is updated for CodeIgniter 2.1 and includes various additions and changes. This uses my [Base CodeIgniter App](https://github.com/mikedfunk/Base-CodeIgniter-App) as a starting point. This is a pre-configured CI setup with tweaks and additions to make CI development easier, more flexible, and fully testable.

Setup
----------

1. Clone this somewhere
2. Update submodules recursively: ```git submodule update --init --recursive```
3. Set writable permissions on **assets/cache** to allow for JS/CSS minification and combination
4. Navigate to the project root and you should see a blog view.

The **master** branch contains the complete finished example, thoroughly documented. The **start** branch takes you back to the starting point where you can create this from scratch.
