CodeIgniter Tutorial
==============================

This is adapted from the original [CodeIgniter video tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/tutorials) by Derek Jones. It is updated for CodeIgniter 2.1 and includes various additions and changes. This uses my [Base CodeIgniter App](https://github.com/mikedfunk/Base-CodeIgniter-App) as a starting point. This is a pre-configured CI setup with tweaks and additions to make CI development easier, more flexible, and fully testable.
